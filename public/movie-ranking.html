<h1>Best Anime According to Rifaldi</h1>

<h2>3 Best Anime of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Charlotte</h3>
<p>This anime is the best in my opinion in terms of story completeness. Both the introduction and the ending are packaged so perfectly that viewers will not question what the ending is like or if there will be a continuation.</p>

<h3>Kimi No Nawa (Your Name)</h3>
<p>This anime is the best movie in my opinion. The plot and the ending feature a plot twist that is hard to predict even though viewers know what is happening. However, the best part of this film is the ending, as it is intentionally made open-ended, allowing viewers to imagine what happens next. The final line of dialogue in the film is also the title of the movie.</p>

<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p>This long-duration anime is the best and never gets boring to watch repeatedly. The main character's goal, simply to find his father, seems trivial compared to the ambitions of other characters. However, the best part of this series is the journey and the ambitions realized through struggle, conveying that enjoying the journey is more important than achieving the desired outcome.</p>
